# Artist's Popular Tracks | Spotify
A simple app created using React.js and OAuth to get access to Spotify that lists the popular songs from a particular artist. The app displays the album cover and some info upon clicking on the song (card). This utilizes Spotify's APIs to search for artist ID, albums, and songs.
